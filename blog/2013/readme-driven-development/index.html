          <p>Among <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>&rsquo;s many contributions to software development, the prominence it affords the README is undervalued. By making it obvious to users where to start looking for info about a project, it also gives developers a good starting point.</p>
          <p>I try to fully embrace the README and treat it as a first-class citizen alongside code and tests. This is similar to <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html">Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;working backwards&rdquo; approach</a>. Werner Vogels summarises it as </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>start by writing the documents we&rsquo;ll need at launch (the press release and the faq) and then work towards documents that are closer to the implementation</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Starting with the README puts the developer in the mindset of the user. Questions such as &ldquo;what is this for?&rdquo;, &ldquo;what does the user need to know to get started?&rdquo;, &ldquo;what do I want the API to look like?&rdquo; come to the fore right away. Complex installations, burdensome multi-step operations, etc. are revealed and can be simplified before too many users have to struggle through them.</p>
          <p>While I&rsquo;m not yet quite as rigorous as Amazon and tend to iterate on the code and the README in tandem, the benefits are still sizeable. At the very least, I&rsquo;m guaranteed to have documentation (a project without documentation might as well not exist!). At best, I&rsquo;ll have much better and friendlier software.</p><p>java.net is the opposite of Github, in this respect. 80% of the time, I can&rsquo;t figure out how the library works, because I don&rsquo;t know where the documentation is. java.net itself is very confusing and this rubs off on the projects it hosts. The most catastrophic example of this is Rome, supposedly Java&rsquo;s leading RSS library. The <a href="https://java.net/projects/rome/pages/Home">java.net site</a> links to a URL that has been taken over by spammers. The <a href="https://rometools.jira.com/wiki/display/ROME/Home">real site</a> contains broken links (notably the Tutorials and Articles link!) and very little information.</p>
          <p>When the project is on Github, however, there&rsquo;s a 90% chance there&rsquo;ll be a good README, or at least a pointer to a dedicated site. It&rsquo;s a virtuous circle: Github makes it easy to find the documentation, users feel good about checking out projects on Github and new projects are more likely to make good documentation a priority.</p>
