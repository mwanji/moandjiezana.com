      <h1>The New Old-School Blog</h1>
      - history
      - want to write static html in "notepad": no 3rd party tooling, author from anywhere
      - plain html + web components + html -> rss generator
      - web components: API better suited to distributed web components than site-specific ones? Or am I using it wrong?
        - social-links: pure HTML, so what I actually want is a bit of HTML I can reuse
        - external CSS: only applied to light DOM
        - no API whatsoever to include external resources or add styles? Template string literals are not an API
        - tradeoff: repeated HTML vs. JavaScript required. Only use for unimportant things: eg. social media links
        - fonts: need to be imported in host and in web component (security reasons?). Impact on Font Awesome.
      - CSS: custom properties, @import, CSS grid => great!
