Here are a few ways to make it a little less painful than having to click 5 times go get somewhere:
 
- search bar: Cmd + E (I guess Ctrl + E on Windows) gets you to the search bar, and from there you can search for people, teams and meetings
- goto: Cmd + G (or /goto in the search bar) lets you jump to a team or channel
- Activity Feed: I find this the easiest way to follow what people are saying in Team Channels
- back / forward: you can use the arrows next to the search bar to navigate backwards and forwards, like in a browser. This is handy when you jump from a team or file to a chat and want to come back. As an advanced tip, you can configure the side buttons on your Logitech mouse to trigger the back and forward shortcuts, so you can navigate teams from your mouse buttons. If anyone wants to know how, I'm happy to help.
- slash commands: in the search bar, you can use special commands to get specialised search. Eg. /files lets you search through files. You can see all / commands with Cmd + Shift + /
- local file sync: In a channel's Files tab, click on "Sync" and that will continuously sync all the channel's files to your hard drive. Then you can use your OS's search feature to find your team's files. On Mac, Cmd + Space opens Spotlight, and you can search for files there. On Windows, I think the Start menu provides similar functionality.
- Office app integration: You can open Files in Teams directly from Word, Excel, etc. Also, if you open a file in Teams or online, it will show up in your Recent Files in the desktop apps.
