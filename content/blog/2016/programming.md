og_description=The story of how I started programming
~~~~~~

When I left France for Sussex University in Brighton, England, to study International Relations, it felt like I was fulfilling my destiny.

Both of my parents worked for U.N. organisations and we had lived in many parts of the world: Trinidad, New York, Kenya, France. So when I flipped through the course catalogue and came across the promise of understanding how the world worked through the lens of its international actors, the decision was easy and instantaneous.

I started university in autumn 1996 and soon used the Internet for the first time. I was immediately engrossed. As soon as I realised I could create my own content, I bought a book on HTML, set up a site on Geocities and spent hours trying to get a table layout that mimicked [Star Trek: The Next Generation's console design](https://www.google.com/search?q=star+trek+control+panel&espv=2&biw=638&bih=705&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjU67yUuNzLAhUH5GMKHX_qCFgQsAQIGw#tbm=isch&q=star+trek+next+generation+control+panel). This culminated in creating the first online version of the university's student newspaper.

I continued working with HTML and CSS during summer internships at UNESCO and the ILO. When I moved to Brussels in 2001, enrolling in a programming course seemed as natural and obvious as International Relations had been 5 years earlier. The course itself proved me right: the lessons just clicked and everything felt easy.

Today, 15 years later, not everything is so easy to learn and apply, but programming still feels like the simple and natural thing to be doing.
