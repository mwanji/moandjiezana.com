<p>An easy way to unit test convenience methods: bootstrap them with the already-tested methods they&apos;re simplifying the interface of.</p>

<p>The advantage is that you&apos;re doing state-based rather than interaction-based testing and the assertions are fairly readable (and would be even more so with FEST-Assert).</p>
